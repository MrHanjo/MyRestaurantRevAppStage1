QUICKSTART:

Spin up the server with:
	python -m http.server 8000

Then open up the following URL in your internet browser:
	http://localhost:8000

Details below.


ABOUT THE CONTENT:
This material was for an educational project at Udacity.  It simulated a task of adding Responsiveness, Accessibility and a Service Worker to a site that was lacking all of these.  

TO THE REVIEWER AT UDACITY:
I tried to comment notes in the various scripts to explain my actions. Of course I did not comment on everything as many changes were made.
API Keys are in the script and should work.

## Project Overview: Stage 1
responsive on different sized displays and accessible service worker 


1. In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer. 

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.



## Leaflet.js and Mapbox:

This repository uses [leafletjs](https://leafletjs.com/) with [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). You need to replace `<your MAPBOX API KEY HERE>` with a token from [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/). Mapbox is free to use, and does not require any payment information. 

### Note about ES6

Most of the code in this project has been written to the ES6 JavaScript specification for compatibility with modern web browsers and future proofing JavaScript code.
